Place training videos and labels_train.xlsx here.

For the visual model (Task 1 & 2), preprocessed face frames should be 
in subdirectories named after each video (without extension).

Example:
  dataset/train/labels_train.xlsx
  dataset/train/subject_1_Vid_5/frame_0001.jpg
  dataset/train/subject_1_Vid_5/frame_0002.jpg
