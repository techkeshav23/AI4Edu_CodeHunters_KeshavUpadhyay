# Hackathon Rules Clarification & Key Takeaways

**Event:** Pre-AI Summit Hackathon (24 Hours) @ IIT Ropar
**Track:** AI for Education (Task: Student Engagement Recognition)

## 🚨 Critical Development Rules (Strict Adherence Required)

### 1. No Pre-Written Code Logic
*   **Allowed:** 
    *   Boilerplate code (folder structure, empty files).
    *   Configuration files (`requirements.txt`, `config.py`).
    *   Open-source libraries (PyTorch, OpenCV, MediaPipe).
    *   Pre-trained Models (ResNet18, etc.) - **Must cite source**.
*   **Prohibited (Before 3 PM Feb 6th):**
    *   Writing the actual core logic (custom training loops, specific algorithm implementations).
    *   Using code from previous personal projects.

### 2. Timeline & Release Policy
*   **Problem Statement Release:** 3:00 PM (Feb 6th).
*   **Coding Starts:** 4:00 PM (Feb 6th).
*   **Dataset Release:** 3:00 PM (Feb 6th). (**Do not** attempt to find it earlier - instant disqualification).

## 🛠️ Track 2 Specifics: AI for Education

### Pre-requisites (Allowed Preparation)
*   Teams are **expected** to explore **rPPG extraction methods** beforehand. This is research, not coding.

### rPPG Algorithm Constraints
You **MUST** implement **3** out of these 7 specific algorithms:
1.  **CHROM** (Chrominance-based)
2.  **POS** (Plane-Orthogonal-to-Skin)
3.  **DeepPhys** (Deep Learning based)
4.  PhysNet
5.  EfficientPhys
6.  PhysFormer
7.  TS-CAN

## 💾 Submission & deliverables

1.  **Public GitHub Repository:**
    *   Must contain `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.
    *   Complete source code.
    *   Instructions for training and inference.
2.  **Output Files:** Specific format to be announced at release time.
3.  **Max Submissions:** Only **2** final submissions allowed.

---

## 🖥️ Computing Environment

*   **GPU Access:** NxtGen/C-DAC GPUs provided (A5000/V100).
*   **Access Method:** SSH from your own laptop.
*   **Hardware Requirement:** Bring your own laptop & charger.

## 🏆 Evaluation Checkpoints

Be ready to show progress at these times:
1.  **Day 1 - 8:00 PM** (Checkpoint 1)
2.  **Day 1 - Midnight** (Checkpoint 2)
3.  **Day 2 - 4:00 AM** (Checkpoint 3)
4.  **Day 2 - 8:00 AM** (Checkpoint 4)
5.  **Day 2 - Noon** (Checkpoint 5)
6.  **Final Submisson:** Day 2 - 3:30 PM

## ⚠️ Disqualification Triggers
*   Plagiarism / Copying projects.
*   Non-functional submission.
*   Accessing dataset before official release time.
